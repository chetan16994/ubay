•	Progress Since Last Milestone:

Since the last milestone we have spent a lot of time working on getting the basic routes and functionality of the project. /n
We found a template that we thought would be a good fit for the project and we used it to help us move forward. /n
After finding the template we organized the folders following MVC standards and connected the database so we could store user information /n
along with product information into the database. A user can preform CRUD operations for their account and also submit products that can be sold or auctioned off. /n
We found a way to display products according to their categories. We also created specific pages for shopping and for bidding. /n


•	Problems Encountered / Questions:
We still haven't figured out a good way to upload and store an image of the products that are going to be listed. /n
We are not sure if mulder is a good option or if we should continue looking. We still have a lot of design/styling changes that we will /n 
need to make for the final submission of the project.
