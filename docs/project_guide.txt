1. Application URL: TO DO 

2. Application Summary:  Write a 1-4 paragraph summary description of your application.  
This can be similar to the project description you submitted in milestone 1,
but you may need to be a bit more detailed.  You should include the purpose of the application,
 a description of its intended users, and a brief summary of its features.
Write the description to give an overview of the applicationâ€™s functionality to someone 
who is completely unfamiliar with your application.

Over the semester we spent our time building an e-commerce website. We liked the idea of having multiple
ways to sell a product. For that reason, we created an auction page for users to list their products
to auction and a shopping page for users to sell their products like normal. Because anyone is allowed
to create an account and list products we were required to have an Administrator of the website that
could go online and verify and approve the products. We did this with hopes to eliminate spam and false 
sales. When a user goes online to place a bid, the current price increases by 10% with each bid. 
 

3. Routing Guide:

GET /: Renders the home page
GET /category/:id: Renders the different category views

GET /bidding: Updates the reminaing time, checks if the bid has expired, and then takes appropriate action, and then renders a view that shows all active auctions
GET /bidding/sell: Renders a view for a user to list a product for auction
POST /bidding/create: sends product information to the database and then renders appropriate view
GET /bidding/:id/:id2/placeBid: id1: product ID, id2: current_price- changes the current bidding price and registers the user as the highest bidder 

GET /shopping/: Shows all the products that are listed for shopping
GET /shopping/sell: renders a view for a product to be listed for sale
POST/shopping/create: Sends product information to the database and then renders appropriate view
GET /shopping/:id/addToCart: Adds product to the users cart and then renders appropriate view
GET /shopping/:id/buy: Adds product to users completed orders and then removes it from the users cart
GET /shopping/orders: Shows a view of all the users orders for auctions and shopping
GET /shopping/cart: renders a view of a users cart


GET /users/login: Renders a view for a user to login to account
GET /users/signup: Renders a view for a visitor to create an account
POST /users/login: verifies user information and logs them into their account
GET /users/new: renders the view for a user account to be created
POST /users/create: verifies that user information is correct, sends the information to the database, and renders appropriate view
GET /users/logout: Logs a user out of their account
GET /users/:id: Shows a user their acccount information
GET /users/:id/edit: renders a view for a user to edit their account information
PUT /users/:id/update: sends updated user information to the database and renders appropriate view

GET /admin/bidding: Shows all the auction products that have been submitted and are awaiting admin approval
GET /admin/shopping: Shows all the shopping products that have been submitted and are awaiting admin approval
GET /admin/:id/approveBid: approves an individual auction item for auction and then renders appropriate view
GET /admin/:id/approveShop: approves an individual shopping item and then renders appropriate view
GET /admin/:id/disapprove: Denies both bidding and shopping products if the admin doesnt approve

router.get("/products",apiController.verifyToken, apiController.getProduct,apiController.respondJSON);
it first verifiesthe token in the URL and if correct fetches the product details and responds in JSON format
router.get("/token", apiController.getToken);
retuens a secured json web token
router.get("/external", apiController.externalApi);
fetches the external Api using axios which renders a view of fake json data

User Credentials and Roles: List any user roles supported by your application.  For each role, list the routes to which the role has exclusive access. 
Also, include a sample user account for each role that I can use to access your system.  Example:

Application Roles
1. Admin
    -Exclusive Route Access: admin/shopping, admin/bidding, admin/:id/edit
    -Sample User Account:  username: frosty@snowman.com, password: frosty
2. Customers
    -Exclusive Route Access:  users/myOrders, shopping/cart, shopping/orders, shopping/sell, 
    shopping/:id/addToCart, shopping/:id/buy, bidding/sell, bidding/:id/:id2/placeBid, users/profile,
    users/:id/edit
    -Sample User Account: username: santa@clause.com password: santa

Project Requirements:  
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1. 5 interlinked dynamic pages (views)
| that display dynamic, database-driven
| content per team member.  To be counted
| as dynamic, the page must retrieve
| information to and/or write information to
| the application database using one or more
| queries/data access functions written by the
| team. 
|
|2. At least 5 database transactions (a transaction includes selecting, inserting, updating, or deleting data from the database) per team member                                   |                                           |
